	abstract = {Improvements in the accuracy and availability of long-­read sequencing mean that complete bacterial genomes are now routinely reconstructed using hybrid (i.e. short- and long-­reads) assembly approaches. Complete genomes allow a deeper understanding of bacterial evolution and genomic variation beyond single nucleotide variants. They are also crucial for identifying plasmids, which often carry medically significant antimicrobial resistance genes. However, small plasmids are often missed or misassembled by long-­read assembly algorithms. Here, we present Hybracter which allows for the fast, automatic and scalable recovery of near-­perfect complete bacterial genomes using a long-r­ead first assembly approach. Hybracter can be run either as a hybrid assembler or as a long-­read only assembler. We compared Hybracter to existing automated hybrid and long-­read only assembly tools using a diverse panel of samples of varying levels of long-­read accuracy with manually curated ground truth reference genomes. We demonstrate that Hybracter as a hybrid assembler is more accurate and faster than the existing gold standard automated hybrid assembler Unicycler. We also show that Hybracter with long-r­eads only is the most accurate long-r­ ead only assembler and is comparable to hybrid methods in accurately recovering small plasmids.},

	abstract = {As the prevalence of antimicrobial resistance genes is increasing in microbes, we are facing the return of the pre-antibiotic era. Consecutively, the number of studies concerning antibiotic resistance and its spread in the environment is rapidly growing. Next generation sequencing technologies are widespread used in many areas of biological research and antibiotic resistance is no exception. For the rapid annotation of whole genome sequencing and metagenomic results considering antibiotic resistance, several tools and data resources were developed. These databases, however, can differ fundamentally in the number and type of genes and resistance determinants they comprise. Furthermore, the annotation structure and metadata stored in these resources can also contribute to their differences. Several previous reviews were published on the tools and databases of resistance gene annotation; however, to our knowledge, no previous review focused solely and in depth on the differences in the databases. In this review, we compare the most well-known and widely used antibiotic resistance gene databases based on their structure and content. We believe that this knowledge is fundamental for selecting the most appropriate database for a research question and for the development of new tools and resources of resistance gene annotation.},

	abstract = {Evaluation of the quality of genomic “data products” such as genome assemblies or gene sets is of critical importance in order to recognize possible issues and correct them during the generation of new data. It is equally essential to guide subsequent or comparative analyses with existing data, as the correct interpretation of the results necessarily requires knowledge about the quality level and reliability of the inputs. Using datasets of near universal single-copy orthologs derived from {OrthoDB}, {BUSCO} can estimate the completeness and redundancy of genomic data by providing biologically meaningful metrics based on expected gene content. These can complement technical metrics such as contiguity measures (e.g., number of contigs/scaffolds, and N50 values). Here, we describe the use of the {BUSCO} tool suite to assess different data types that can range from genome assemblies of single isolates and assembled transcriptomes and annotated gene sets to metagenome-assembled genomes where the taxonomic origin of the species is unknown. {BUSCO} is the only tool capable of assessing all these types of sequences from both eukaryotic and prokaryotic species. The protocols detail the various {BUSCO} running modes and the novel workflows introduced in versions 4 and 5, including the batch analysis on multiple inputs, the auto-lineage workflow to run assessments without specifying a dataset, and a workflow for the evaluation of (large) eukaryotic genomes. The protocols further cover the {BUSCO} setup, guidelines to interpret the results, and {BUSCO} “plugin” workflows for performing common operations in genomics using {BUSCO} results, such as building phylogenomic trees and visualizing syntenies. © 2021 The Authors.

Genes can move within and between genomes at fast rates because of mobile genetic elements ({MGEs}). Although mobile elements are fundamentally self-interested entities, and thus replicate for their own gain, they frequently carry genes beneficial for their hosts and/or the neighbours of their hosts. Many genes that are carried by mobile elements code for traits that are expressed outside of the cell. Such traits are involved in bacterial sociality, such as the production of public goods, which benefit a cell's neighbours, or the production of bacteriocins, which harm a cell's neighbours. In this study we review the patterns that are emerging in the types of genes carried by mobile elements, and discuss the evolutionary and ecological conditions under which mobile elements evolve to carry their peculiar mix of parasitic, beneficial and cooperative genes.},

	abstract = {Uropathogenic Escherichia coli ({UPEC}) is extremely diverse genotypically and phenotypically. Individual strains can variably carry diverse virulence factors, making it challenging to define a molecular signature for this pathotype. For many bacterial pathogens, mobile genetic elements ({MGEs}) constitute a major mechanism of virulence factor acquisition. For urinary E. coli, the total distribution of {MGEs} and their role in the acquisition of virulence factors is not well defined, including in the context of symptomatic infection versus asymptomatic bacteriuria ({ASB}). In this work, we characterized 151 isolates of E. coli, derived from patients with either urinary tract infection ({UTI}) or {ASB}. For both sets of E. coli, we catalogued the presence of plasmids, prophage, and transposons. We analyzed {MGE} sequences for the presence of virulence factors and antimicrobial resistance genes. These {MGEs} were associated with only {\textasciitilde}4\% of total virulence associated genes, while plasmids contributed to {\textasciitilde}15\% of antimicrobial resistance genes under consideration. Our analyses suggests that, across strains of E. coli, {MGEs} are not a prominent driver of urinary tract pathogenesis and symptomatic infection. {IMPORTANCE} Escherichia coli is the most common etiological agent of urinary tract infections ({UTIs}), with {UTI}-associated strains designated "uropathogenic" E. coli or {UPEC}. Across urinary strains of E. coli, the global landscape of {MGEs} and its relationship to virulence factor carriage and clinical symptomatology require greater clarity. Here, we demonstrate that many of the putative virulence factors of {UPEC} are not associated with acquisition due to {MGEs}. The current work enhances our understanding of the strain-to-strain variability and pathogenic potential of urine-associated E. coli and points toward more subtle genomic differences distinguishing {ASB} from {UTI} isolates.},

We previously introduced {MEGARes}, a comprehensive {AMR} database with an acyclic hierarchical annotation structure that facilitates high-throughput computational analysis, as well as {AMR}++, a customized bioinformatic pipeline specifically designed to use {MEGARes} in high-throughput analysis for characterizing {AMR} genes ({ARGs}) in metagenomic sequence data. Here, we present {MEGARes} v3.0, a comprehensive database of published {ARG} sequences for antimicrobial drugs, biocides, and metals, and {AMR}++ v3.0, an update to our customized bioinformatic pipeline for high-throughput analysis of metagenomic data (available at {MEGLab}.org). Database annotations have been expanded to include information regarding specific genomic locations for single-nucleotide polymorphisms ({SNPs}) and insertions and/or deletions (indels) when required by specific {ARGs} for resistance expression, and the updated {AMR}++ pipeline uses this information to check for presence of resistance-conferring genetic variants in metagenomic sequenced reads. This new information encompasses 337 {ARGs}, whose resistance-conferring variants could not previously be confirmed in such a manner. In {MEGARes} 3.0, the nodes of the acyclic hierarchical ontology include 4 antimicrobial compound types, 59 resistance classes, 233 mechanisms and 1448 gene groups that classify the 8733 accessions.},

However, their involvement in chronic diseases remains poorly understood. Here, we establish an expanded {VFG} database ({VFDB} 2.0) consisting of 62,332 nonredundant orthologues and alleles of {VFGs} using species-specific average nucleotide identity (https://github.com/Wanting-Dong/{MetaVF}\_toolkit/tree/main/databases). We further develop the {MetaVF} toolkit, facilitating the precise identification of pathobiont-carried {VFGs} at the species level. A thorough characterization of {VFGs} for 5452 commensal isolates from healthy individuals reveals that only 11 of 301 species harbour these factors. Further analyses of {VFGs} within the gut microbiomes of nine chronic diseases reveal both common and disease-specific {VFG} features. Notably, in type 2 diabetes patients, long {HiFi} sequencing confirms that shared {VF} features are carried by pathobiont strains of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae. These findings underscore the critical importance of identifying and understanding {VFGs} in microbiome-associated diseases.},

	abstract = {Integrons are flexible gene-exchanging platforms that contain multiple cassettes encoding accessory genes whose order is shuffled by a specific integrase. Integrons embedded within mobile genetic elements often contain multiple antibiotic resistance genes that they spread among nosocomial pathogens and contribute to the current antibiotic resistance crisis. However, most integrons are presumably sedentary and encode a much broader diversity of functions. {IntegronFinder} is a widely used software to identify novel integrons in bacterial genomes, but has aged and lacks some useful functionalities to handle very large datasets of draft genomes or metagenomes. Here, we present {IntegronFinder} version 2. We have updated the code, improved its efficiency and usability, adapted the output to incomplete genome data, and added a few novel functions. We describe these changes and illustrate the relevance of the program by analyzing the distribution of integrons across more than 20,000 fully sequenced genomes. We also take full advantage of its novel capabilities to analyze close to 4000 Klebsiella pneumoniae genomes for the presence of integrons and antibiotic resistance genes within them. Our data show that K. pneumoniae has a large diversity of integrons and the largest mobile integron in our database of plasmids. The pangenome of these integrons contains a total of 165 different gene families with most of the largest families being related with resistance to numerous types of antibiotics. {IntegronFinder} is a free and open-source software available on multiple public platforms.},

	abstract = {Objectives
Antimicrobial resistance ({AMR}) in clinically relevant bacteria is a growing threat to public health globally. In these bacteria, antimicrobial resistance genes are often associated with mobile genetic elements ({MGEs}), which promote their mobility, enabling them to rapidly spread throughout a bacterial community.

Methods
The tool {MobileElementFinder} was developed to enable rapid detection of {MGEs} and their genetic context in assembled sequence data. {MGEs} are detected based on sequence similarity to a database of 4452 known elements augmented with annotation of resistance genes, virulence factors and detection of plasmids.

Results
{MobileElementFinder} was applied to analyse the mobilome of 1725 sequenced Salmonella enterica isolates of animal origin from Denmark, Germany and the {USA}. We found that the {MGEs} were seemingly conserved according to multilocus {ST} and not restricted to either the host or the country of origin. Moreover, we identified putative translocatable units for specific aminoglycoside, sulphonamide and tetracycline genes. Several putative composite transposons were predicted that could mobilize, among others, {AMR}, metal resistance and phosphodiesterase genes associated with macrophage survivability. This is, to our knowledge, the first time the phosphodiesterase-like {pdeL} has been found to be potentially mobilized into S. enterica.

Conclusions
{MobileElementFinder} is a powerful tool to study the epidemiology of {MGEs} in a large number of genome sequences and to determine the potential for genomic plasticity of bacteria. This web service provides a convenient method of detecting {MGEs} in assembled sequence data. {MobileElementFinder} can be accessed at https://cge.cbs.dtu.dk/services/{MobileElementFinder}/.},

	abstract = {Antibiotic consumption and its abuses have been historically and repeatedly pointed out as the major driver of antibiotic resistance emergence and propagation. However, several examples show that resistance may persist despite substantial reductions in antibiotic use, and that other factors are at stake. Here, we study the temporal, spatial, and ecological distribution patterns of aminoglycoside resistance, by screening more than 160,000 publicly available genomes for 27 clusters of genes encoding aminoglycoside-modifying enzymes ({AME} genes). We find that {AME} genes display a very ubiquitous pattern: about 25\% of sequenced bacteria carry {AME} genes. These bacteria were sequenced from all the continents (except Antarctica) and terrestrial biomes, and belong to a wide number of phyla. By focusing on European countries between 1997 and 2018, we show that aminoglycoside consumption has little impact on the prevalence of {AME}-gene-carrying bacteria, whereas most variation in prevalence is observed among biomes. We further analyze the resemblance of resistome compositions across biomes: soil, wildlife, and human samples appear to be central to understand the exchanges of {AME} genes between different ecological contexts. Together, these results support the idea that interventional strategies based on reducing antibiotic use should be complemented by a stronger control of exchanges, especially between ecosystems.},

	abstract = {Plasmids are extrachromosomal genetic elements that replicate independently of the chromosome and play a vital role in the environmental adaptation of bacteria. Due to potential mobilization or conjugation capabilities, plasmids are important genetic vehicles for antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors with huge and increasing clinical implications. They are therefore subject to large genomic studies within the scientific community worldwide. As a result of rapidly improving next-generation sequencing methods, the quantity of sequenced bacterial genomes is constantly increasing, in turn raising the need for specialized tools to (i) extract plasmid sequences from draft assemblies, (ii) derive their origin and distribution, and (iii) further investigate their genetic repertoire. Recently, several bioinformatic methods and tools have emerged to tackle this issue; however, a combination of high sensitivity and specificity in plasmid sequence identification is rarely achieved in a taxon-independent manner. In addition, many software tools are not appropriate for large high-throughput analyses or cannot be included in existing software pipelines due to their technical design or software implementation. In this study, we investigated differences in the replicon distributions of protein-coding genes on a large scale as a new approach to distinguish plasmid-borne from chromosome-borne contigs. We defined and computed statistical discrimination thresholds for a new metric: the replicon distribution score ({RDS}), which achieved an accuracy of 96.6 \%. The final performance was further improved by the combination of the {RDS} metric with heuristics exploiting several plasmid-specific higher-level contig characterizations. We implemented this workflow in a new high-throughput taxon-independent bioinformatics software tool called Platon for the recruitment and characterization of plasmid-borne contigs from short-read draft assemblies. Compared to {PlasFlow}, Platon achieved a higher accuracy (97.5 \%) and more balanced predictions (F1=82.6 \%) tested on a broad range of bacterial taxa and better or equal performance against the targeted tools {PlasmidFinder} and {PlaScope} on sequenced

Here, we present the results of a method that circumvents these problems by requiring only the identification of the conjugation genes and the species’ pan-genome. We delimited 200 {ICEs} and this allowed the first large-scale characterization of these elements. We quantified the presence in {ICEs} of a wide set of functions associated with the biology of mobile genetic elements, including some that are typically associated with plasmids, such as partition and replication. Protein sequence similarity networks and phylogenetic analyses revealed that {ICEs} are structured in functional modules. Integrases and conjugation systems have different evolutionary histories, even if the gene repertoires of {ICEs} can be grouped in function of conjugation types. Our characterization of the composition and organization of {ICEs} paves the way for future functional and evolutionary analyses of their cargo genes, composed of a majority of unknown function genes.},
